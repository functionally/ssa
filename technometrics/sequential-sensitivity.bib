	abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,…,Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,…,Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,…,Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

	abstract = {In regression analysis, there are two main aims: interpretation and prediction, which can be also applied in building performance analysis. Interpretation is used to understand the relationship between input parameters and building energy performance (also called sensitivity analysis), whereas prediction is used to create a reliable energy model to estimate building energy consumption. This article explores the implementation of a distribution-free bootstrap method for these two purposes. The bootstrap is a resampling method that enables assessment of the accuracy of an estimator by random sampling with replacement from an original dataset. An office building is used as a case study to demonstrate the application of this method in assessing building thermal performance. The results indicate that the probabilistic sensitivity analysis incorporating the bootstrap approach provides valuable insights into the variations in sensitivity indicators, which are not available from typical deterministic sensitivity analysis. The single point values from deterministic methods may lead to misleading prioritization of energy saving measures because they do not provide the distributions of sensitivity indicators. Information on prediction errors obtained from the bootstrap method can facilitate the selection of an appropriate building energy metamodel to more accurately predict the energy consumption of buildings, compared with the traditional one-time data splitting method (also called holdout cross-validation method), which partitions the data into a training set and a test set.},

	abstract = {Variance-based sensitivity indices have established themselves as a reference among practitioners of sensitivity analysis of model output. It is not unusual to consider a variance-based sensitivity analysis as informative if it produces at least the first order sensitivity indices S\_j and the so-called total-effect sensitivity indices T\_j for all the uncertain factors of the mathematical model under analysis. Computational economy is critical in sensitivity analysis. It depends mostly upon the number of model evaluations needed to obtain stable values of the estimates. While efficient estimation procedures independent from the number of factors under analysis are available for the first order indices, this is less the case for the total sensitivity indices. When estimating T\_j, one can either use a sample-based approach, whose computational cost depends fromon the number of factors, or approaches based on meta-modelling/emulators, e.g. based on Gaussian processes. The present work focuses on sample-based estimation procedures for T\_j and tries different avenues to achieve an algorithmic improvement over the designs proposed in the existing best practices. We conclude that some proposed sample-based improvements found in the literature do not work as claimed, and that improving on the existing best practice is indeed fraught with difficulties. We motivate our conclusions introducing the concepts of explorativity and efficiency of the design.},

Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in the model building and result communication process. Through sensitivity analysis we gain essential insights on model behavior, on its structure and on its response to changes in the model inputs. Several interrogations are possible and several sensitivity analysis methods have been developed, giving rise to a vast and growing literature. We present an overview of available methods, structuring them into local and global methods. For local methods, we discuss Tornado diagrams, one way sensitivity functions, differentiation-based methods and scenario decomposition through finite change sensitivity indices, providing a unified view of the associated sensitivity measures. We then analyze global sensitivity methods, first discussing screening methods such as sequential bifurcation and the Morris method. We then address variance-based, moment-independent and value of information-based sensitivity methods. We discuss their formalization in a common rationale and present recent results that permit the estimation of global sensitivity measures by post-processing the sample generated by a traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We then investigate in detail the methodological issues concerning the crucial step of correctly interpreting the results of a sensitivity analysis. A classical example is worked out to illustrate some of the approaches.},

	abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in building energy analysis. It can be used to identify the key variables affecting building thermal performance from both energy simulation models and observational study. This paper is focused on the application of sensitivity analysis in the field of building performance analysis. First, the typical steps of implementation of sensitivity analysis in building analysis are described. A number of practical issues in applying sensitivity analysis are also discussed, such as the determination of input variations, the choice of building energy programs, how to reduce computational time for energy models. Second, the sensitivity analysis methods used in building performance analysis are reviewed. These methods can be categorized into local and global sensitivity analysis. The global methods can be further divided into four approaches: regression, screening-based, variance-based, and meta-model sensitivity analysis. Recent research has been concentrated on global methods because they can explore the whole input space and most of them allow the self-verification, i.e., how much variance of the model output (building energy consumption) has been explained by the method used in the analysis. Third, we discuss several important topics, which are often overlooked in the domain of building performance analysis. These topics include the application of sensitivity analysis in observational study, how to deal with correlated inputs, the computation of the variations of sensitivity index, and the software issues. Lastly, the practical guidance is given based on the advantages and disadvantaged of different sensitivity analysis methods in assessing building thermal performance. The recommendations for further research in the future are made to provide more robust analysis in assessing building energy performance.},

In this work, we introduce a new sensitivity index which looks at the influence of input uncertainty on the entire distribution of the multivariate output without reference to a specific moment of the output. The definition of the new index is based on the multivariate probability integral transformation (PIT), which can take into account both of the uncertainties and the correlations among multivariate output. The mathematical properties of the proposed sensitivity index are discussed and its differences with the sensitivity indices previously introduced in the literature are highlighted. Two numerical examples and a rotating shaft model of an aircraft wing are employed to illustrate the validity and potential benefits of the new sensitivity index.},

We present here a general way to correct a bias which occurs when estimating sensitivity indices (SIs) of any order – except total SI of single factor or group of factors – by the random balance design method (RBD) and its hybrid version, RBD-FAST. In the RBD case, this positive bias has been recently identified in a paper by Xu and Gertner [1]. Following their work, we propose a bias correction method for first-order SIs estimates in RBD. We then extend the correction method to the SIs of any order in RBD-FAST. At last, we suggest an efficient strategy to estimate all the first- and second-order SIs using RBD-FAST.},

The extension consists of a tree-structured density estimation technique which allows the characterization of complex interaction in that portion of the parameter space which gives rise to successful simulation. Results show that the parameter space can be partitioned into small, densely populated regions and relatively large, sparsely populated regions. From the high-density regions one can identify the important or controlling parameters as well as the interaction between parameters in different local areas of the space.

	abstract = {A novel approach for estimation variance-based sensitivity indices for models with dependent variables is presented. Both the first order and total sensitivity indices are derived as generalizations of Sobolʼ sensitivity indices. Formulas and Monte Carlo numerical estimates similar to Sobolʼ formulas are derived. A copula-based approach is proposed for sampling from arbitrary multivariate probability distributions. A good agreement between analytical and numerical values of the first order and total indices for considered test cases is obtained. The behavior of sensitivity indices depends on the relative predominance of interactions and correlations. The method is shown to be efficient and general.},

	abstract = {The variance ratio function, derived from the contribution to sample variance (CSV) plot, is a regional sensitivity index for studying how much the output deviates from the original mean of model output when the distribution range of one input is reduced and to measure the contribution of different distribution ranges of each input to the variance of model output. In this paper, the revised mean and variance ratio functions are developed for quantifying the actual change of the model output mean and variance, respectively, when one reduces the range of one input. The connection between the revised variance ratio function and the original one is derived and discussed. It is shown that compared with the classical variance ratio function, the revised one is more suitable to the evaluation of model output variance due to reduced ranges of model inputs. A Monte Carlo procedure, which needs only a set of samples for implementing it, is developed for efficiently computing the revised mean and variance ratio functions. The revised mean and variance ratio functions are compared with the classical ones by using the Ishigami function. At last, they are applied to a planar 10-bar structure.},

They underpin our search for understanding of earth system functioning and support decision- and policy-making across spatial and temporal scales. To understand the implications of uncertainty and environmental variability on the identification of such earth system models and their predictions, we can rely on increasingly powerful Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) methods. Previous reviews have characterised the variability of GSA methods available and their usability for different tasks. In our paper we rather focus on reviewing what has been learned so far by applying GSA to models across the earth system sciences, independently of the specific algorithm that was applied. We identify and discuss 10 key findings with general applicability and relevance for the earth sciences. We further provide an A-B-C-D of best practise in applying GSA methods, which we have derived from analysing why some GSA applications provided more insight than others.},

  abstract = {Since AASHTO released the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) for public review in 2004, many highway research agencies have performed sensitivity analyses using the prototype MEPDG design software. The information provided by the sensitivity analysis is essential for design engineers to better understand the MEPDG design models and to identify important input parameters for pavement design. In literature, different studies have been carried out based on either local or global sensitivity analysis methods, and sensitivity indices have been proposed for ranking the importance of the input parameters. In this paper, a regional sensitivity analysis method, Monte Carlo filtering (MCF), is presented. The MCF method maintains many advantages of the global sensitivity analysis, while focusing on the regional sensitivity of the MEPDG model near the design criteria rather than the entire problem domain. It is shown that the information obtained from the MCF method is more helpful and accurate in guiding design engineers in pavement design practices. To demonstrate the proposed regional sensitivity method, a typical three-layer flexible pavement structure was analyzed at input level 3. A detailed procedure to generate Monte Carlo runs using the AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design software was provided. The results in the example show that the sensitivity ranking of the input parameters in this study reasonably matches with that in a previous study under a global sensitivity analysis. Based on the analysis results, the strengths, practical issues, and applications of the MCF method were further discussed.},

The data necessary to adequately estimate the parameters of these complex models are often not available. Monte Carlo filtering, the process of rejecting sets of mode! simulations that fail to meet prespecified criteria of model performance, is a useful procedure for objectively establishing parameter values and improving confidence in model predictions. This paper uses a foodweb model to examine the relationship between model sensitivities and Monte Carlo filtering. Results show that Monte Carlo filtering with a behavior definition that is closely related to the sensitivity structure of the model will produce substantial reductions in model forecasting uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Space-filling designs are a convenient and effective approach for exploring the input space for experiments. However, standard choices for these designs strive to provide uniform density of points throughout the region of interest. There are numerous situations where flexibility to adapt the density of points to match specific design objectives would be advantageous to maximize the efficiency of the design. In this paper, we propose non-uniform space-filling (NUSF) designs to achieve a user-specified desired density distribution of design points across the input space and demonstrate how to implement NUSF designs in different ways to provide the experimenters with flexibility to match their goals. The approach is flexible for a variety of scenarios where the experimenter wishes to control the density of points throughout the region while still preserving the space-filling characteristic. Details are provided about how to translate a problem into an appropriate weight structure to generate several designs which can then be compared using graphical methods, including the Closest Distance by Weight plot, to determine if the desired characteristics have been achieved. The methods are demonstrated with two real examples with different requirements for design point placement.},

We propose a method that incorporates known dependencies between input variables into design selection for simulators and demonstrate the benefits of this approach via a simulator for atmospheric dispersion. We quantify the benefit of the new techniques over standard space-filling and Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed methods are adaptations of computer-generated spread and coverage space-filling designs, with ‘distance’ between two input points redefined to include a weight function. This weight function reflects any known multivariate dependencies between input variables and prior information on the design region. The methods can include quantitative and qualitative variables, and different types of prior information. Novel graphical methods, adapted from fraction of design space plots, are used to assess and compare the designs.},

  abstract = {As computer simulations continue to grow in size and complexity, they present a particularly challenging class of big data problems. Many application areas are moving toward exascale computing systems, systems that perform 1018 FLOPS (FLoating-point Operations Per Second)—a billion billion calculations per second. Simulations at this scale can generate output that exceeds both the storage capacity and the bandwidth available for transfer to storage, making post-processing and analysis challenging. One approach is to embed some analyses in the simulation while the simulation is running—a strategy often called in situ analysis—to reduce the need for transfer to storage. Another strategy is to save only a reduced set of time steps rather than the full simulation. Typically the selected time steps are evenly spaced, where the spacing can be defined by the budget for storage and transfer. This article combines these two ideas to introduce an online in situ method for identifying a reduced set of time steps of the simulation to save. Our approach significantly reduces the data transfer and storage requirements, and it provides improved fidelity to the simulation to facilitate post-processing and reconstruction. We illustrate the method using a computer simulation that supported NASA's 2009 Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite mission.},
